# ML_assignment2_2025AA05826
## Overview
This is a repo to implement assignment 2 of Machine Learning in Sem 1. It involves training multiple classification models and then hosting a Streamlit app which takes in input data and predicts the output based on the selected model.

## Models Being Used
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. KNN
4. Naive Bayes
5. Random Forest (Ensemble)
6. XGBoost (Ensemble)

## Evaluation Metrics
For each of the models above, calculate the following evaluation metrics:
1. Accuracy
2. AUC Score
3. Precision
4. Recall
5. F1 Score
6. Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC Score)

## Model Performance Observations
Add your observations on the performance of each model on the chosen dataset:

| # | ML Model Name | Observation about model performance |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Logistic Regression | |
| 2 | Decision Tree | |
| 3 | kNN | |
| 4 | Naive Bayes | |
| 5 | Random Forest (Ensemble) | |
| 6 | XGBoost (Ensemble) | |
